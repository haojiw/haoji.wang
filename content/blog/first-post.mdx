description: An introduction to my blog and what to expect
---

Ever Since I was a jit I been legit. 

This post is completely AI generated and just for testing markdown display.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you can expect:

- Tutorials on frontend development
- Thoughts on design systems
- Reviews of new tools and technologies
- Personal projects and case studies

## My Approach to Web Development

I believe in clean, semantic code that is accessible to everyone. My projects are built with performance and user experience in mind, using modern technologies while ensuring backward compatibility.

### The Technologies I Love

Currently, I'm excited about:

1. Next.js and React server components
2. Tailwind CSS for styling
3. TypeScript for type safety
4. Design systems for consistency

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component using TypeScript:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

type CounterProps = {
  initialValue?: number;
};

const Counter = ({ initialValue = 0 }: CounterProps) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
  
  return (
    <div className="p-4 border rounded">
      <p className="text-xl">Count: {count}</p>
      <button 
        onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}
        className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded mt-2"
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```
