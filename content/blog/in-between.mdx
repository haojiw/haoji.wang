description: On the duality of being human, and learning to live with balance. For anyone caught between finding peace and chasing more.

Over the years, I’ve written a lot about life. Maybe too much, but I guess it never runs out of things to say. Some pieces are clear, most are messy. Still, almost all of them revolve around this common theme: the intricate balance I’ve been trying to find.

That balance lives in the space — often the tension — between two opposing truths: ambition and peace; freedom and responsibility; confidence and humility; authenticity and privacy; giving to others and honoring the self; love and lust; connection and solitude. 

At first, I thought one side had to be better than the other. Understandable, we all have been there before. Black-and-white always feels safer than grey. So I’d lean hard in one direction and completely overlook the other, until the universe humbles me in its own loving way. 

- Too much ambition burnt me out; too much peace dulled my hunger. 
- Too much freedom left me lost; too much responsibility kept me trapped.
- Living for others drained me; living only for myself made me empty. 
- Being fully open left me exposed; keeping everything in made me feel unknown. 

Eventually I came to know, these dilemmas aren’t avoidable and don’t need to be fixed.  
They are a part of what it means to be human — a divine soul living in an animal’s body.  

Freud calls it the superego and the id.  I call it **the god and the beast:**

One reaches for love, purpose, transcendence;  
the other craves pleasure, power, survival.

The mind is the middle ground and the battlefield. Yo, no wonder it is such a messy place — you probably shouldn’t live there. 

One day I let go of my obsession to flatten myself into something I could decode. That day I become free. *You’re not meant to figure yourself out completely. You’re meant to live yourself out fully.*

The process of learning to live with that — to believe, to confuse, to fall, to get back up, and to keep walking — is what people call “growing up.” 

Every kid I met wants to grow up.  
Every grown-up I know hated growing up.  
But at the end of the day we all gotta do it.

So I stopped trying to label every feeling, judge every impulse, make sense of who I am.  
We’re all just trying to walk that line — between the part of us that reaches for heaven and the part that’s trying to stay grounded.

I’m still walking that line. One way forward, no maps.  
You probably walking it too — that’s why you’re here today.  

And when we just keep going, one day something changes.  
We catch ourselves carrying this strange kind of joy: not loud, not dramatic, just there.  
It says: *you are whole.*  
The tension’s still there, but you’ve found peace living with it.

And if we ever meet on that line, I hope we’ll recognize each other.  
I will tell you congratulations.  
It didn’t get easier. **You got better.**
